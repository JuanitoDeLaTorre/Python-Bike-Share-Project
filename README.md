# Python-Bike-Share-Project
For Udacity's Data Analyst in Python and Pandas Course

## Description
This program computes descriptive statistics for bike share data from Chicago, NYC, and Washington DC. The program allows the user to filter by city, month, and day of the week. The program is written in Python and harnesses the power of Pandas and Numpy to accomplish very fast statistical computations.


## Installation
This program only requires two packages: time (used for measuring efficiency) and pandas.

```import pandas as pd```

```import time```

The program is run in console and does not require any browser.


## Features
The following statistics are provided by the program for a given search:
- Most common travel months, days, and hours
- Most popular start and end stations as well as most common combination of the two (total trip)
- Total/average trip duration for all users during time range
- A breakdown of user types (subscriber or customer) and gender (for those who volunteered that information)

_Sources of information included Udacity's Programming for Data Science in Python course, ChatGPT, and StackOverflow_

### Note
The course-provided data for Washington did not include user demographic information like gender and birth year so concessions had to be made in the code to manage that data inconsistency.
