# Python-Bike-Share-Project
For Udacity's Data Analyst in Python and Pandas Course

This program computes descriptive statistics for bikeshare data from Chicago, NYC, and Washington DC. The program allows the user to filter by city, month, and day of the week. 

The following statistics are provided by the program for a given search:
- Most common travel months, days, and hours
- Most popular start and end stations as well as most common combination of the two (total trip)
- Total/average trip duration for all users during time range
- A breakdown of user types (subscriber or customer) and gender (for those who volunteered that information)

The program is written in Python and harnesses the power of Pandas and Numpy to accomplish very fast statistical computations.
